    "Background": "I work in gamma-ray astronomy which is concerned with measuring the highest-energy radiation produced in the universe and understanding its cosmic origin. I work on processing data from ground-based gamma-ray observatories. These \u201csee\u201d gamma-rays through snapshots of the Cherenkov light from the particle-cascades originating from the interactions of the gamma-rays in the atmosphere. Therefore, our datasets are images of particle-cascades, produced at kHz rates each night. The goal is to denoise these images, infer the arrival direction and energy of the original gamma-rays, and filter out background images. These are tasks well-suited to the application of machine learning.",
    "ML_Experience": "I have machine-learning experience from courses and research work.    I have taken courses on physics-related machine learning during my master\u2019s and have attended lectures and colloquia on this topic during my PhD too, providing a foundation on methods and terminologies.     On the research side, I have developed a machine-learning-based reconstruction method for Cherenkov images of gamma-ray particle-cascades. This method uses techniques from the field of simulation-based inference and, for the first time, applies them to gamma-ray astronomy. In the context of this, I have also familiarized myself with other machine-learning solutions for this task, such as tree-based methods and CNNs.",
    "Motivation": "I think the problems solved by machine learning are quite similar between the subfields of physics, but the language in which they are thought about and thus the solutions can be quite different. I therefore hope to be inspired and learn new approaches and ways of thinking about my tasks from the lecturers and participants with different backgrounds.      In particular, I would like to learn more about the statistical and probabilistic nature and interpretation of machine-learning methods. With this, I would like to achieve more rigorous statistical uncertainties in my inference problems, which has proven difficult so far.",
